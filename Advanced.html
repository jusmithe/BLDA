<p>
Due to the great success of our programs and the interest of our students in
Salsa and Ballroom Dancing, we have created two new stable dancing bodies: the
<emph> Salsa Performance Group </emph> and the <emph> Ballroom Team
</emph>. Our Goals are:
</p>

<ul>     
  <li>Offer a venue for advanced instruction for our students. </li>
  <li>Offer the possibility to showcase our students skills in various settings.
  Both groups showcase choreographies at various events organized by the BLDA
  and other RSOs, while the Salsa Performance Group also specifically dances at
  the two Chicago Salsa Congressos and the Ballroom team competes at various
  competitions at other universities.
  </li>
</ul>
        
<p>
If you are interested in joining us, or want to have us perform at your event,

  <li>Ballroom Team: <em>ballroomteam [at] uchicago [dot] edu</em></li>
</ul>
</p>
        

<h2> Salsa Performance Group</h2>
<p>
The Salsa Performance Group is a great opportunity to learn new and more
advanced moves, perfect and polish the known ones, and showcase your talents to
your friends and fellow students. The goal is to learn and prepare performances
to be shown at the Chicago Salsa Congresses but also in events such as OLAS,
ManosUnidas, Dance Marathon, where people can learn more about our club and join
us in the fun of dance!
</p>

<p>
We usualy have two rounds of open auditions--at the beginning of the school year
in early October and once again in March. Everyone is welcome to come to
try-outs! Performers will then practice 1 hour a week, with more practices
scheduled before performances.
</p>
<p>
So come try us out! If you have any questions about auditions, the group or if
you want to schedule a performance please email us at bldawebandmoney [at]
uchicago.
</p>

<h2>Ballroom Competition Team </h2>

<p>
The University of Chicago Competitive Ballroom and Latin Dance Team   was
founded in the Fall of 2007 to provide talented students the   opportunity to
compete at ballroom dance competitions at the   intercollegiate level. The team
currently has around 10 active members.   Besides competing, the team also
perform in campus events like the OLAS   show, Dance Marathon, etc.
