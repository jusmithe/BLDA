Lessons are usually sequences of four weeks each, taught in  weekly one-hour
installments.  No partners required for classes! Classes are 5$ a class, or 16$
if you pay for a 4-week sequence upfront -12$ for a 3-week sequence.
Please show up a  ten minutes early for your first class to make sure we can
start on time. Also, all sequence payments are due by the second week of
classes. Professionally taught workshops are twice the rate at 8$ per hour with
ID, and 10$ without. Private classes with our instructors can be arranged by
