        <h1>Chicago Salsa Scene</h1>
        <p>We've recieved many questions about the social dancing scene outside the club-- our monthly and special event mixers can only provide so much dancing. As such, many of our instructors and students regularily explore the salsa scene--below are some of the locales you may be interested in.</p>

        <h2>BLDA</h2>
        <p>Okay, so we just admitted we can only provide so much dancing, but don't forget to come to open salsa, Seven Ten on the first or second Wed of every month (always check <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bldauchicago">our facebook page</a> for the next event!) and any special dances we may have, also available on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bldauchicago">our facebook page</a> at least a week in advance as well as on our listhost.<p>

        <h2>Dance Studios</h2>
        <p> Chicago's dance studios are great locations to further improve your dancing skills. These locations not only offer advanced level classes, but also additional opportunities to perform, and regular mixers to practice your dancing.</p>

        <h2>Salsa Nights in Chicago</h2>
        <p>Chicago has a vibrant salsa/bachata nightlife! Below are the two main
        organizers of salsa events, they will often have deals for people who RSVP in
        advance, or something similar. Often these salsa nights will also offer a
        complimentary lesson before the DJ begins spinning. General rule: get there at
        10:30pm.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Tuesday: Alhambra</strong> [1240 W Randolph St.] Cover is $5 if you RSVP on facebook! 
        An older crowd of pretty good dancers, especially hopping when there's a performance.
        Lesson at 7:30. Doors open at 7pm, goes until 2am. Easy access from Green Line
        Morgan stop.<emph>21+</emph>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Tuesday: Dolphin</strong> [2200 N Ashland Ave.] Cover is $5. Usually not too crowded
        unless there's a performance or competition. Club feel. As of May 2014, they 
        are trying out a live bachata band that does horrible Royce covers, but the band
        is only on for an hour.<emph>21+</emph>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Wednesday: Footrise at Candela</strong> [2451 N. Milwaukee Ave.] Cover is 7$, dancing until 1. Not crowded and a nice place with a spacious dance floor. El Caobo is the DJ. Run by MMA. Easy access from Logan Square Blue Line stop.<emph>21+</emph>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Wednesday: Lalo's on Maxwell</strong> [733 W Maxwell St.] Cover is free! 
        Usually super packed to the point of not being able to dance without getting stepped on,
        but there are some great dancers there every week and delicious margaritas.<emph>21+</emph>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Thursday: Castle</strong> [632 N. Dearborn] Cover is 7$ (Free with LSD's
        VIS Card). Often has a surplus of leads, but it remains the only club which two
        seperate floors for latin dancing--one for salsa/chacha and another for
        bachata/merengue/cumbia. <emph>21+</emph>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Thursday: Patron's</strong> [316 W Erie St.] No cover! This place is almost always
        super popular, with great dancers and fantastic passionfruit margaritas. <emph>21+</emph>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Friday: Dylan's</strong> [118 S Clinton St.] Cover is $5-10. Usually a smaller, older
        crowd but on nights when nothing else is happening or there's a good band,
        it can get pretty packed with great dancers. <emph>21+</emph>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Fridays and Saturdays: Latin Rhythms</strong> [210 N. Racine] has socials every other week
        or so. 5$ with membership, 10$ without. Always a popular event; check their <a href="http://www.latinrhythmsdance.com/">website</a> for details. All ages!
        </p>

        <p><strong>Sundays: Cubby Bear</strong> [1059 W Addison St.] Cover is $10 (Free with LSD's VIS Card).
        A very well attended salsa night, often has live music or competitions. <emph>21+</emph>

          Website: <a href="http://www.4fantasticevents.com/">http://www.4fantasticevents.com/</a>
          <br/>
          Cover for their events is 10$, but drops down to 5$ with a RSVP (Facebook or
          email) and before 10:30pm. They have events nearly every night of the week,
          but the big one is Alhambra Palace on Tuesdays.
