    <h1>Chicago Salsa Scene</h1>
<p>
We've recieved many questions about the social dancing scene outside the
club-- our monthly and special event mixers can only provide so much dancing. As
such, many of our instructors and students regularily explore the salsa
scene--below are some of the locales you may be interested in.
</p>

<h2>BLDA</h2>
<p>
Okay, so we just admitted we can only provide so much dancing, but don't forget to come
to open salsa, Seven Ten on the first or second Wed of every month (always check 
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/bldauchicago">our facebook page</a><br> for the next event!)
and any special dances we may have, also available on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bldauchicago">our facebook page</a><br>
at least a week in advance as well as on our listhost.
<p>

<h2>Dance Studios</h2>
<p> 
Chicago's dance studios are great locations to further improve your dancing
skills. These locations not only offer advanced level classes, but also
additional opportunities to perform, and regular mixers to practice your
dancing.

<h2>Salsa Nights in Chicago</h2>
<p>
Chicago has a vibrant salsa/bachata nightlife! Below are the two main
organizers of salsa events, they will often have deals for people who RSVP in
advance, or something similar. Often these salsa nights will also offer a
complimentary lesson before the DJ begins spinning. General rule: get there at
10:30pm.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Tuesday: Alhambra</strong> [1240 W Randolph St.] Cover is $5 if you RSVP on facebook! 
An older crowd of pretty good dancers, especially hopping when there's a performance.
Lesson at 7:30. Doors open at 7pm, goes until 2am. Easy access from Green Line
Morgan stop.<br/>
<emph>21+</emph>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Tuesday: Dolphin</strong> [2200 N Ashland Ave.] Cover is $5. Usually not too crowded
unless there's a performance or competition. Club feel. As of May 2014, they 
are trying out a live bachata band that does horrible Royce covers, but the band
is only on for an hour.<br/>
<emph>21+</emph>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wednesday: Footrise at Candela</strong> [2451 N. Milwaukee Ave.] Cover is 7$,
 dancing until 1. Not crowded and a nice place with a spacious dance floor.
 El Caobo is the DJ. Run by MMA. Easy access from Logan Square Blue Line stop.<br/>
<emph>21+</emph>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wednesday: Lalo's on Maxwell</strong> [733 W Maxwell St.] Cover is free! 
Usually super packed to the point of not being able to dance without getting stepped on,
but there are some great dancers there every week and delicious margaritas.<br/>
<emph>21+</emph>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thursday: Castle</strong> [632 N. Dearborn] Cover is 7$ (Free with LSD's
VIS Card). Often has a surplus of leads, but it remains the only club which two
seperate floors for latin dancing--one for salsa/chacha and another for
bachata/merengue/cumbia.<br/>
 <emph>21+</emph>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thursday: Patron's</strong> [316 W Erie St.] No cover! This place is almost always
super popular, with great dancers and fantastic passionfruit margaritas.<br/>
<emph>21+</emph>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Friday: Dylan's</strong> [118 S Clinton St.] Cover is $5-10. Usually a smaller, older
crowd but on nights when nothing else is happening or there's a good band,
it can get pretty packed with great dancers. <br/>
<emph>21+</emph>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Fridays and Saturdays: Latin Rhythms</strong> [210 N. Racine] has socials every other week
or so. 5$ with membership, 10$ without. Always a popular event; check their <a href="http://www.latinrhythmsdance.com/">website</a><br> for details.<br/>
