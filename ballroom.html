        <h3>Lessons</h3>
        <p>Our student instructors provide lessons for all! We teach to all levels and ranges of experience, mostly focusing on beginners. You do not need a partner, previous dance experience, or even dance shoes to get started. Our lessons are weekly in Ida Noyes Hall. Our goals are:</p>

        <ul>     
          <li>Teaching all four styles of Ballroom dance: American Smooth and Rhythm 
          and International Standard and Latin </li>
          <li>Emphasize lead and follow and technique over step-patterns and routines </li>
          <li>Providing opportunities to practice what you've learned on a regular basis 
          to prepare for competitions </li>
        </ul>
          
        <p>Currently we have the capacity to teach Beginning and Intermediate level lessons, which are at the Newcomer and Bronze levels, respectively. If you are seeking more advanced study, then please speak to our instructors about a correct placement and recommendation to a local studio. In the future after our first year of holding student-taught lessons, we hope to bring professional instructors to the campus on a regular basis for more advanced lessons and workshops.</p>
          
        <p>Our lessons package is offered as $20/quarter or $5/evening.</p>

        <h3>Practices </h3>
        <p>To foster the development of our dancers, we provide space about 2x/week for practice for about 2 hours each. During these times, we lead warmups, conduct drills, and provide extra tips and technique. Come closer to competition season, we will run practice "rounds". Practices are the best opportunity for individual attention and/or free time to practice on your own--whichever fits you. For these sessions you do not need a partner or prior experience. They are free of charge, though we recommend that you attend lessons at the same time by purchasing the quarterly package.</p>

        <p>We do not acquire the space and times on a regular schedule, and so to find out when our practices are, join our mailing list or Facebook group: UofC Ballroom Dance Team.</p>

        <h3> Competitions </h3>
        <p>The University of Chicago Ballroom Dance Team competes in the collegiate division at other Midwestern universities. A competition involves successive rounds of each style of dance (Waltz, Tango, Rumba etc..). 20+ couples dance at the same time while judges mark their favorites. If enough judges like your dancing, you're brought back into the next round until only 8 couples remain. The judges then place the couples 1-8 and you'll receive a ribbon! Competitions typically involve a full day of dancing, opportunities to meet and witness amazing dancers from other colleges, and bonding time between your teammates. There are no tryouts for the team nor do you need a partner to start! Levels of competition start at the Newcomer level (with 0-6 months experience).</p>

        <p>Competitions are typically an all-day event on a Saturday. In most cases, the team will be driving together on Friday night and returning Sunday morning. Our team does not have membership dues! Accordingly, individuals are responsible for paying a flat rate determined by the overall cost of the competition and the amount of funding provided by The University of Chicago. We estimate $25-$45/competition, not including food. This price is a subsidized rate from our RSO, and so we require that you regularly attend our club events (practices and lessons) before receiving this subsidy. We currently are planning on attending 4-5 competitions a year. If you're interested in competing, contact us!</p>
